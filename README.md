##1st task
1.Reads the number n and create an array of size n.Iterates through the array to find the minimum element
2.Time complexity:O(n)

##2nd task
1.Calculates through the array the sum of all elements
2.Divides the sum by the num of element to find the average
3.Time complexity: O(n)

##3rd task
1.To check whether a given number n is prime or composite
2.The isPrime function takes an integer n as input and returns true if n is prime, and false otherwise
3.Time complexity:O(n)

##4th task
1.The factorial method calculates the factorial of a given number "n" using recursion
2.Time complexity:O(n)

##5th task
1.In the recursive case, the method recursively calls itself with n-1 and n-2 to calculate the (n-1)th and (n-2)th elements in the sequence, and returns their sum
2.Time complexity:O(2^n)

##6th task
1.The program gives the power of the n
2.Time complexity:O(n)

##7th task
1.Defines a recursive method called reverseArr
2.Takes 2 parameters: the array and the index of the current element to be swap by themselves
3.Time complexity:O(n)

##9th task
1.Reads 2 integers n and k,calculates the binomial coefficient C(n,k)
2.Time complexity:O(2^n)

##10th task
1.Finds GCD of a and b using Euclidean Algorithm
2.Time complexity:O(log(n))
