1st task


Reads the number n and create an array of size n.Iterates through the array to find the minimum element


Time complexity:O(n)

2nd task


Calculates through the array the sum of all elements


Divides the sum by the num of element to find the average


Time complexity: O(n)

3rd task


To check whether a given number n is prime or composite


The isPrime function takes an integer n as input and returns true if n is prime, and false otherwise


Time complexity:O(n)

4th task


The factorial method calculates the factorial of a given number "n" using recursion


Time complexity:O(n)

5th task


In the recursive case, the method recursively calls itself with n-1 and n-2 to calculate the (n-1)th and (n-2)th elements in the sequence, and returns their sum


Time complexity:O(2^n)

6th task


The program gives the power of the n


Time complexity:O(n)

7th task


Defines a recursive method called reverseArr


Takes 2 parameters: the array and the index of the current element to be swap by themselves


Time complexity:O(n)

9th task


Reads 2 integers n and k,calculates the binomial coefficient C(n,k)


Time complexity:O(2^n)

10th task


Finds GCD of a and b using Euclidean Algorithm


Time complexity:O(log(n))
